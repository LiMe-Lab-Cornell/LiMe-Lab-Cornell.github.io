    Thank you for your interest in participating in our studies! The majority of
    our experiments are web-based. Most of our experiments are posted in crowd
    sourcing platforms such as
    <a href="https://www.prolific.co/">Prolific</a> or
    <a href="https://www.mturk.com/worker">Mechanical Turk.</a> You can find our
    studies by searching 'LiMe Lab @ Cornell' on either platform.

    We also run in-lab experiments. If you are local to the Ithaca area and
    would like to participate in one of our experiments, please send us an email
    to<image src="image\email2.png" class="email_img"></image>
    We will continue to update this page with information about ongoing in-lab
    studies.
