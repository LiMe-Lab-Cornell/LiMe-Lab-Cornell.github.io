  **Aparicio, H.**, Levy, R., Coppock, E.*Referential garden path effects in modified Haddock descriptions.*
abstract: "As Haddock (1987) points out, the rabbit in the hat is perfectly felicitous in a scenario with multiple hats. The uniqueness requirement of the lower definite in these nested (definite) descriptions pertains to rich descriptive content: not hat (absolute reading), but rabbit-containing hat (relative reading). **The incrementalist view:** For Haddock, the loosening of the uniqueness requirement is due to an incremental procedure by which constraints are successively imposed on discourse referents. Haddock envisions a constraint satisfaction problem that can be formalized as a set of open formulas like rabbit(U+1D465), in(U+1D465, U+1D466), and hat(&#119910), applied in sequence. The uniqueness requirement of the inner definite is satisfied if there is only one satisfier of y left, or in other words, if the candidate set has only one element. The scope-based view: Like Haddock, Bumford (2017) assumes that the imposes a cardinality-one check on the candidate set for the relevant discourse referent, but it is scope that determines what constraints have applied prior to this check. Both views predict relative-like readings for nested definite descriptions containing gradable modifiers like the rabbit in the big/bigger bag, but only the scope view predicts absolute readings. In this paper, we give experimental evidence for the scope-based approach, by showing that participants access absolute interpretations. The evidence comes from **referential garden paths,** where a dynamic constraint evaluation process temporarily settles on the wrong referent before eventually failing. It is exactly when the scope-based theory predicts referential garden paths—including absolute readings—that we observe penalties."
